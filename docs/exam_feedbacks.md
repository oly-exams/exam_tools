# Exam Feedbacks
Exams feedbacks are enabled after the presentation of the exam questions from the organizers and will be closed when we start the discussions.
Feedbacks will be reviewed by the organizers and are visible to all delegations.
The status will change from **Submitted** to **In progress** and finally to **Resolved**.

## Overview

## Add Feedback

A popupmenu appears giving you a range of options to specify the target of your feedback. Select a question for which you want to give feedback and choose the part and subpart this feedback is related to. The closer this specification is related to your question the better will the authors be able to implement changes according to your intentions.
