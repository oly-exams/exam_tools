Exams feedbacks are enabled after the presentation of the exam questions from the organizers and will be closed when we start the discussions.

Feedbacks will be reviewed by the organizers and are visible to all delegations.

The status will change from **Submitted** to **In progress** and finally to **Resolved**, then the organizers take care of it.
