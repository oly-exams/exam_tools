# Welcome on the Exam Tools Documentation


During this year edition we will use for the first time an entirely web-based management of the exams. Exam feedbacks, translations, printing, voting, corrections and ranking are among the features of this new tool.

During the registration process you will need to confirm that your delegation will join with at least one supported notebook computer, and that you were successfully able to translate the test exams. Note that the organizers will not provide any notebooks or workstations to the delegations (except with prior arrangement).


## Try it now!

The testing we require for the registration is basically composed by these steps:

1. Enter the exam section
1. [Define a new language](language_settings.md)
1. [Start the translation](exam_editor.md)
1. [Generate the question PDF](compile_pdf.md)
1. Repeat if translation in more languages is needed
1. [Assign the languages to the students and submit](assign_exams.md)

To guide you through this process we prepared a [**step-by-step**](step_by_step.md) guide which reports the tasks that you already completed and explains how to perfom the next steps.
