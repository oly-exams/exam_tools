# Welcome on the Exam Tools Documentation


This is the user documentation for the Exam Tools, a web-based management tool that was introduced at the IPhO 2016. Exam feedbacks, translations, printing, voting are among the features of this tool.


## Translation Process

The translation process consists of the following steps:

1. Enter the exam section
1. [Define a new language](language_settings.md)
1. [Start the translation](exam_editor.md)
1. Generate the printable version
1. Repeat if translation in more languages is needed
1. [Assign the languages to the participants and submit](assign_exams.md)

To guide you through this process we prepared a [**step-by-step**](step_by_step.md) guide which reports the tasks that you already completed and explains how to perfom the next steps.

Of course, you can always ask a Team Guide or IT Staff member for help.
